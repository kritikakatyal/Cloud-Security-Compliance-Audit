# Troubleshooting Guide â€“ Cloud Security Compliance Audit

This troubleshooting guide provides solutions to common issues that you may encounter while performing a **Cloud Security Compliance Audit** using **Nessus** on cloud environments like **AWS**, **Azure**, and **Google Cloud**. Follow the steps below to resolve problems related to scanning, configuration, or other aspects of the setup.

## **1. Nessus Installation Issues**

### Issue: Nessus is not starting or is not accessible from the web browser.
- **Solution**: 
  1. Verify that Nessus is properly installed and running by checking the system logs:
     - **Linux**: Use `sudo systemctl status nessusd` to check the status of the Nessus service.
     - **Windows**: Check the Task Manager to see if the Nessus service is running.
  2. If Nessus is not running, restart it:
     - **Linux**: `sudo systemctl restart nessusd`
     - **Windows**: Restart the Nessus service from the Services manager.
  3. Ensure that Nessus is listening on the correct port (default is `8834`). You can check the firewall or network settings if you cannot access the web interface.

## **2. Cloud Configuration Issues**

### Issue: Nessus cannot connect to AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.
- **Solution**:
  1. **AWS**: Ensure that you have the correct **AWS Access Key** and **Secret Key**. Verify the IAM permissions for these keys to ensure that Nessus has the necessary access rights.
  2. **Azure**: Check that the Azure credentials (Client ID, Tenant ID, Secret) are correct. Ensure that the role assigned to the Azure account has sufficient privileges to scan the resources.
  3. **Google Cloud**: Confirm that the **Service Account Key** JSON file is valid and that the service account has appropriate permissions (e.g., **roles/viewer**, **roles/storage.admin**, etc.).

### Issue: Cloud environment is not appearing in Nessus.
- **Solution**: 
  1. Double-check your **configuration settings** in Nessus.
  2. Ensure the **API access** is enabled and that Nessus has the correct permissions to access the cloud environment.
  3. If using IAM roles, ensure that the role has the correct trust relationships and policies assigned.

## **3. Scan Configuration Issues**

### Issue: Scan does not start or fails to run.
- **Solution**:
  1. Ensure that the **scan target** (e.g., AWS EC2 instance IP, Azure VM, etc.) is correctly specified.
  2. Double-check that the **scan type** is properly selected and configured.
  3. Check if any **firewall rules** or **security groups** are blocking Nessus from accessing the target resources.
  4. Review the **Nessus logs** for more specific error messages:
     - **Linux**: `/opt/nessus/var/nessus/logs/nessusd.messages`
     - **Windows**: `C:\Program Files\Tenable\Nessus\nessus\logs\`

### Issue: Scan completes with no results or only partial results.
- **Solution**:
  1. Verify that the **credentials** provided for cloud access (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) have sufficient privileges to scan the resources.
  2. Ensure that the resources you are scanning (e.g., EC2 instances, VMs, etc.) are online and accessible.
  3. Check for network connectivity issues between the Nessus scanner and the target resources.

## **4. Scan Results Issues**

### Issue: The scan results are incomplete or incorrect.
- **Solution**:
  1. Review the **scan configuration** to ensure all relevant resources were included in the scan.
  2. If you are scanning for vulnerabilities in cloud services, ensure that Nessus is configured to use the latest vulnerability plugins.
  3. Double-check that the **compliance standards** (CIS, NIST, PCI-DSS) selected are appropriate for your cloud environment and that Nessus supports these standards for the selected cloud provider.

### Issue: Nessus is reporting false positives.
- **Solution**:
  1. Review the detailed descriptions of each finding. Some vulnerabilities might be reported due to misconfigurations in the scan itself.
  2. For false positives related to **cloud configuration** (e.g., security group settings), ensure the scan settings are accurate and exclude resources that are not relevant.
  3. If you believe a vulnerability report is a false positive, you can disable the related plugin or adjust its settings in the scan configuration.

## **5. Compliance Issues**

### Issue: Compliance check does not show the expected results.
- **Solution**:
  1. Ensure that the cloud environment is properly configured to meet the **CIS**, **NIST**, or **PCI-DSS** standards.
  2. Verify that the correct compliance template is selected in the **scan configuration**.
  3. Review the compliance report in detail to ensure that Nessus is scanning the correct resources in the cloud environment.
  4. For **AWS**, use AWS Config to audit configurations for compliance with security standards.

## **6. Network Connectivity Issues**

### Issue: Nessus cannot reach the target IPs in the cloud environment.
- **Solution**:
  1. Verify that **security groups** or **firewall rules** in the cloud environment are correctly configured to allow traffic from Nessus.
  2. Ensure that the **Nessus scanner machine** can communicate with the target instances over the correct ports (e.g., SSH for Linux instances, RDP for Windows instances).
  3. Check if **VPC** or **subnet** settings are preventing Nessus from reaching the resources.

## **7. General Troubleshooting Tips**

### Issue: Nessus is running slowly or scans are taking too long.
- **Solution**:
  1. Ensure that your **Nessus machine** has enough resources (CPU, memory, disk space) to handle the scanning load.
  2. Break down large scans into smaller segments by targeting specific resources at a time.
  3. Reduce the scan scope to focus on the most critical assets first.

### Issue: Unable to save or load scans in Nessus.
- **Solution**:
  1. Ensure that you have sufficient disk space available on the system where Nessus is running.
  2. Try clearing out old or unused scans from the Nessus interface to free up space.
  3. Restart Nessus to resolve any temporary issues related to session timeouts or corrupted scan files.
