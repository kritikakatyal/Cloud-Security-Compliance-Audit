# Cloud Security Compliance Audit ‚Äì Nessus Scanning

This repository provides a comprehensive guide for performing a **Cloud Security Compliance Audit** using **Nessus** on **AWS** cloud environments. The goal of this project is to assess the security configurations of AWS infrastructure, identify potential vulnerabilities, and ensure compliance with industry-standard security frameworks like **CIS**, **NIST**, and **PCI-DSS**.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Project Overview**

In this project, **Nessus** is used to scan the configurations of **AWS** cloud services and detect misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in cloud infrastructure, which can expose sensitive data or allow unauthorized access.

### **Key Features:**
- **Security Scanning**: Automated security scans of AWS configurations and resources to identify security risks.
- **Compliance Audits**: Ensures that your AWS infrastructure complies with various security standards like **CIS**, **NIST**, and **PCI-DSS**.
- **Vulnerability Detection**: Detects potential vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in your AWS resources, such as open ports, improper security group configurations, and other risks.
